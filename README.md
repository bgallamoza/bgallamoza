# Hi! I'm Brennan Gallamoza! Welcome to my Page!

I'm a data-loving undergraduate at the University of Delaware majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Biology. My future goal is to make a career in data science! Currently, I am working on personal machine learning projects to develop my skills to become an effective data scientist.

## PROJECTS

### **MyAnimeList Rating Prediction**

#### https://github.com/bgallamoza/MAL_Rating_Regression

- Project created to predict average user ratings of TV anime from the MyAnimeList (MAL) website
- Trained several supervised regression models with Sklearn using features obtained or engineered from MAL API data
- Deployed model on an Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2 instance using a Flask REST API and HTML/Javascript/CSS user interface. Server interacts with a SQLite database to store and retrieve predictions.

### **Crack/Cocaine Usage Binary Classification**

#### https://github.com/bgallamoza/Cocaine_Usage_Classification

- Project created to predict if someone has used crack/cocaine before using 2015-2019 NSDUH survey data
- Trained several supervised classification models with roughly 89% accuracy using demographic and previous substance usage data preprocessed in R and Python
- Built a web application with a Flask REST API and a user interface built in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that allows users to obtain a prediction given their inputted data
